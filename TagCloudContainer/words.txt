Hello
world
My
Wonderful
Family
I
live
in
a
house
near
the
mountains
.
I
have
two
brothers
and
one
sister,
and
I
was
born
last.
My
father
teaches
mathematics,
and
my
mother
is
a
nurse
at
a
big
hospital.
My
brothers
are
very
smart
and
work
hard
in
school.
My
sister
is
a
nervous
girl,
but
she
is
very
kind.
My
grandmother
also
lives
with
us.
She
came
from
Italy
when
I
was
two
years
old.
She
has
grown
old,
but
she
is
still
very
strong.
She
cooks
the
best
food!
My
family
is
very
important
to
me.
We
do
lots
of
things
together.
My
brothers
and
I
like
to
go
on
long
walks
in
the
mountains.
My
sister
likes
to
cook
with
my
grandmother.
On
the
weekends
we
all
play
board
games
together.
We
laugh
and
always
have
a
good
time.
I
love
my
family
very
much.
My
name
is
Oksana.
I
am
a
prospective
teacher
of
biology.
Nature
is
my
hobby.
I
know
a
lot
about
fruit
and
vegetables,
and
about
their
useful
qualities.
My
friends
say
I
am
fond
of
diets,
healthy
food
and
healthy
way
of
life.
That's
true.
Food
is
an
important
part
of
our
life;
it
may
influence
our
mood
and
health.
That's
why
I
always
eat
the
dishes
I
prepare
myself
and
try
to
choose
products,
that
are
useful
for
my
health.
I
live
in
a
hostel,
so
I
do
not
have
much
time
to
prepare
my
breakfast
in
the
morning,
as
I
share
the
kitchen
with
other
students.
But
to
cook
oatmeal
I
need
5—10
minutes.
In
order
to
make
it
tastier,
I
usually
add
fruits
to
it.
I
also
drink
a
glass
of
apple
or
orange
juice
in
the
morning.
At
about
12
o'clock
I
have
my
lunch.
It
is
usually
an
apple,
a
banana
or
a
glass
of
juice.
Sometimes
I
eat
vegetable
salad
or
drink
tea
with
pies.
When
I
come
home
after
classes
I
start
preparing
my
dinner.
It
usually
consists
of
vegetable
soup
for
the
first
course,
stewed
fish
with
vegetables
for
the
second
one
and
stewed
fruits
or
jelly
for
dessert.
I
do
not
have
supper,
as
I
do
not
want
to
overeat
before
going
to
bed.
But
sometimes
I
eat
an
apple
or
drink
a
glass
of
apple
juice.
I
think,
the
food
I
choose
is
healthy
and
helps
me
to
keep
fit.
There
are
many
good
books.
My
parents
have
a
big
library
at
home,
and
when
I
have
spare
time
I
read
some
of
the
books
that
my
parents
read
when
they
were
of
my
age.
I
do
not
think
that
books
written
in
the
19th,
18th
centuries
or
even
earlier
may
not
be
useful
for
a
contemporary
reader.
There
are
over
300
books
in
our
home
library.
Among
them
there
are
plays
by
Shakespeare,
historical
novels
by
Walter
Scott,
detective
stories
by
Conan
Doyle
and
many
others.
But
sometimes,
I
buy
a
new
book.
Contemporary
writers
have
their
own
style
and
manner.
They
write
about
problems
that
people
have
to
face
nowadays.
One
of
the
books
I
have
recently
bought
is
written
by
a
modern
French
writer,
Francois
Lelord.
It
is
called
«Hector's
Trip».
It
is
a
modern
bestseller,
and
is
already
translated
into
several
languages.
It
is
a
story
of
a
young
doctor,
who
decided
to
make
a
world
tour
in
his
search
tor
happiness.
He
wanted
to
understand
what
happiness
means
for
him
and
whether
it
means
the
same
for
all
people
around
the
world.
Hector
meets
many
people
on
his
way.
Some
of
them
look
happy
but
the
reasons
for
that
were
different.
He
learned
that
happiness
does
not
depend
on
money
or
fame.
Hector
met
and
made
many
friends
in
different
countries.
He
observed
their
way
of
life
and
came
to
conclusion
that
there
are
very
many
reasons
for
happiness,
so
that
it
is
not
possible
to
unite
all
of
them.
One
may
become
happy,
if
they
find
their
own
answers
to
the
questions
«What
is
happiness?»
«How
I
may
become
happy?»
Hector
found
his
own
way
to
happiness,
he
understood,
that
he
really
did
not
have
to
travel
so
far
to
find
it.
In
conclusion,
I
think
the
problems
touched
upon
in
the
book
could
be
interesting
for
any
young
person.
I
always
advise
all
my
friends
this
book
to.
